# HashCode 2019

Further work on the Google HashCode 2019 problem. Inspired by work done by Holy Guacamole (see [original](https://github.com/ChrisBertrand/hash19) and [fork](https://github.com/Danjb1/google-hashcode-2019)).

## Instructions

To run with default settings, simply execute:

`py -m guac`

To run for specific files or a subset of provided strategies, comment out as appropriate in `guac/__main__.py` and run as normal.

## Notes

This version runs adaptively by computing the solution with multiple strategies, and returning the best result for each input.
